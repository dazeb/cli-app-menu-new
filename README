#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Script cliappmenu.sh is a menu of CLI applications and commands
#: to help CLI newbies to discover what a command line can do.
#:
#: The typical user is anyone who wants to learn about what types of
#: command line applications are available.
#:
#: This version 4.x IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE with 3.1 and earlier since
#: all the menus are now array driven and created as needed by creating
#: temporary menu files which are deleted when each menu is exited.
#:
#: Reading the text menu data into arrays is more efficient and it allows
#: menus to be displayed using Dialog, Whiptail, or text UI.
#:
#: The code which creates the menu arrays is contained in the library
#: "common_bash_library.lib". It can be used in any BASH script you wish.
#:
#: There are many apps_[application category].lib files because each file
#: has the data to create a single menu and there are about 134 menus in
#: this script. The file naming system is ordered by app menu category.
#: This allows easier locating of a particular apps menu file.
#:
#: Admittedly, the some of the library files for this script are big,
#: particularly "cli-common.lib" and "common_bash_function_library.lib".
#:
#: The "common_bash_function_library.lib" contains tested functions that
#: are designed to be used in any script.
#: 
#: Lastly, because the menus are now generated, there is a performance lag.
#: The script ran fine on a Raspberry Pi 2 1 GB computer.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |       HOW-TO Install this script       |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: This project is in a GitHub.com repository and can be downloaded from 
#: https://github.com/rdchin/cli-app-menu_4.
#:
#:
#: 1. TEMPORARY FILES.
#:
#: This script creates a few temporary files which should be deleted as
#: each menu is exited. It will create one temporary file per menu, and
#: more temporary files to store data, if needed. All temporary files
#: are named after the file name which creates them or uses them.
#:
#: Normally "Dialog" and "Whiptail" menus are static, but I wanted dynamic
#: menus created on-the-fly as needed and did not want to have to code a
#: static menu for each application category as was done in version 3.1 and
#: earlier of this script. Thus the need for temporary files. 
#:
#: 
#: 2. A HIDDEN CONFIGURATION FILE.
#:
#: #: The configuration file: ~/.cliappmenu.cfg 
#: is a hidden file which resides in the user's home directory.
#: It is automatically created when you customize the UI and font colors.
#: It is used to save the user preferences and is created and configured
#: by the Main Menu option "Configure".
#:
#:
#: 3. FILE LOCATIONS (AND SUB-DIRECTORY).
#:
#: The files: 
#:
#: cliappmenu.sh
#: cliappmenu.lib
#: common_bash_function.lib
#:
#: need to be in your home directory /home/<username>.
#:
#: All other files need to be in sub-directory /home/<username>/cliapp-dir.
#: Where <username> represents your linux user name.
#: 
#: You can set the sub-directory to another location within your home
#: directory and/or rename it. 
#:
#: To specify the new location/name of the cliapp-dir sub-directory, 
#: edit the file, cliappmenu.sh. Near the beginning of the script,
#: within the Section "Default Variable Values" you will see the setting
#: of variable CLI_DIR which you can change to another sub-directory.
#:
#:
#:  Beginning of excerpt from script cliappmenu.sh:
#: _______________________________
#:
#: #================================================================================
#: # EDIT THE LINE BELOW TO SET THE DIRECTORY OF THE SUB-MENU "cliapp-dir"
#: # WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE SUB-MENU LIBRARY FILES.
#: #================================================================================
#: #
#: #
#: # Set the location of the "cliapp-dir" sub-directory.
#: # Use a sub-directory where you have privileges to edit the library files
#: # in order to edit the application menu item data.
#: #
#: # If puting the directory within the user's Home directory, then you
#: # cannot use the tilde "~" symbol to represent the user's Home Directory
#: # but must use the long-hand full-name of the user's Home Directory.
#: #
#: # You need to specify CLI_DIR.
#: #
#: # Factory setting is CLI_DIR="/home/<username>/cliapp-dir"
#: #
#: # CLI_DIR="/home/<username>/cliapp-dir"
#:
#: _______________________________
#: End of excerpt from script cliappmenu.sh.
#:
#:
#: 4. CHANGING THE PATH VARIABLE.
#:
#: Append the directory name to your environment $PATH:
#: Edit your /home/<username>/.bashrc or .bash_profile or .profile
#: file and add the directory by adding the lines to the end of the file,
#:                   PATH=$PATH:<User-chosen directory path>/cliapp-dir
#:                   export PATH
#:
#: When cliappmenu.sh is run i.e. "bash cliappmenu.sh",
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: | HOW-TO Set the PATH with file locations|
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: The session-wide (pertaining to a specific user only, not system-wide)
#: setting of the PATH variable can be done in several ways.
#:
#:
#: 1. When using a terminal in a window within a GUI desktop environment
#:    such as Budgie, Enlightenment, Fluxbox, Gnome, IceWM, KDE, LXDE, 
#:    OpenBox, XFCE, etc., the PATH variable is set in the file ~/.bashrc.
#:
#: 2. When using a pure CLI environment without a GUI desktop environment,
#:    the PATH variable may be set in the file(s):
#:    ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login or ~/.profile
#:
#:    Note: If you invoke a GUI environment using "startx" from the CLI,
#:          then you must edit
#:          both    ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile files
#:          or both ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_login   files.
#:          or both ~/.bashrc and ~/.profile files.
#:
#: 3. Non-interactive, non-login shell environment:
#:    reads the file contained in the variable BASH_ENV, if exists.
#:__________________________________________
#:
#: Detailed information about options 1-4.
#:
#: 1. Only for Bash shells running in a terminal in a window in a GUI
#:    desktop environment such as Budgie, Enlightenment, Fluxbox, Gnome,
#:    IceWM, KDE, LXDE, OpenBox, XFCE, etc.
#:
#:    Note: A PATH variable that is set in file ~/.bashrc is only used
#:          when running a Bash shell in a terminal window in a GUI desktop
#:          environment. Therefore, it will be ignored in a pure CLI
#:          environment login shell.
#:
#:    /home/<username>/.bashrc
#:                             ~/.bashrc
#:
#:    Edit the ~/.bashrc file
#:    and add the following line to the end of the file.
#:                             PATH=$PATH:$HOME/cliapp-dir
#:
#:
#: 2. Within a pure CLI environment without a GUI (Gnome, KDE, XFCE, etc):
#:    Only one of these files needs the new PATH statement.
#:
#:    Will work in most shells in either a graphical environment in a
#:    desktop session (i.e. Xterm window session) or a pure CLI environment
#:    login shell.
#:
#:                             ~/.bash_login
#:                             ~/.bash_profile
#:
#:    Edit either the ~/.bash_login or ~/.bash_profile file
#:    and add the following line to the end of the file.
#:                             PATH=$PATH:$HOME/cliapp-dir
#:
#:
#: 3. Within a pure CLI environment without a GUI (Gnome, KDE, XFCE, etc):
#:    The ~/.profile is read last after ~/.bash_login and ~/.bash_profile.
#:
#:    WARNING: Ubuntu ignores ~/.profile
#:             when the file ~/.bash_login or ~/.bash_profile exists.
#:
#:    So edit ~/.profile only if you do not have either of the above files.
#:
#:    Will work in most shells in either a graphical environment in a
#:    desktop session (i.e. Xterm window session) or a pure CLI environment
#:    login shell.
#:
#:    /home/<username_goes_here>/.profile
#:                             ~/.profile
#:
#:    Edit the ~/.profile file and add the line below to the end.
#:                             export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/cliapp-dir"
#:
#:
#: 4. Non-interactive, non-login shell environment:
#:    reads the file contained in the variable BASH_ENV, if exists.
#:
#:    (Not pertinent or relevant since this script is interactive).
#:    Included here to document another way to set the PATH variable.

#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |      Why did I write this script?      |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: I wrote this script for 3 reasons:
#: 1. I wanted a categorized list of command line applications.
#: 2. I wanted to learn bash scripting, i.e. functions, looping, tests.
#: 3. I couldn't find a cli menu to launch cli apps on the web so I thought
#:    I'd give back to the community and perhaps others could build on and
#:    improve on what I've started.

#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |      Why is this menu so complex?      |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: The 4 main goals of this project are:
#:
#: 1) To educate users on what Command-Line application are available.
#:
#: 2) To easily change a menu by adding/deleting a single comment line.
#:
#: 3) To easily add new sub-menus.
#:
#: 4) To automatically change the UI between text, Dialog, or Whiptail
#:    without needing to calculate dialog box sizes or screen size.
#:    (All those calculations are done for you by the f_message functions
#:    within the library, common_bash_function.lib).
#:
#: *I chose ease-of-use over complexity. Complexity creates ease-of-use.
#:
#: *I used to be a MUMPS programmer and QA analyst.
#:
#: *I used to create menus with each menu option in a line of text when I
#:  wrote software in MUMPS (now called "M") and being a QA person, my job
#:  was to try to break programs.
#:
#: *My QA background also explains this crazy documentation of everything
#:  along with the fact that I am (just) still learning bash scripting.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |             Script features            |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: *Designed for ease of extensibility and menu editing.
#:  Each menu is automatically generated and no coding is necessary.
#:
#: *Optimized for 80x24 display or 640x480 pixel displays.
#:  Run-time displayed text is no wider than 80-columns across.
#:  Run-time menus are no longer than 16 items for 24 row displays.
#:  Although the game, "Pacman for Console" needs 32 rows minimum to play.
#:
#: *You can get application help by 'man' or '--help' from the menu prompt.
#:
#: *If an application is not installed, the script can install it using
#:  package managers apt, rpm, slackpkg, pacman or for specific apps,
#:  download it from a web site for manual installation.
#:
#: *If an application needs sudo permissions, the script will automatically
#:  ask the user if sudo should be used.
#:
#: *Starting in version 4, all menus are generated on-the-fly or on-demand.
#:
#: *Menus are now generated as-needed or on-the-fly in temporary files.
#:
#:  For instance, if you open the Main Menu then go through the following
#:  sub-menus: Application Menu, System Menu, and Monitor Menu, then the
#:  script will generate only four menus contained in temporary files which
#:  are deleted as each menu is exited.
#:
#:    MENU                GENERATED TEMPORARY FILE WITH MENU CODE
#:  Main Menu         ~/cliappmenu.sh_menu_main_generated.lib
#:  Application Menu  ~/cliapp-dir/apps.lib.generated
#:  System Menu       ~/cliapp-dir/apps_system.lib.generated
#:  Monitor Menu      ~/cliapp-dir/apps_system_monitors.lib.generated
#:
#:  This is in contrast with version 3 where all the menus were hard-coded
#:  and multiple menus were contained in a single file so a unique 3-letter
#:  string to identify a given menu was required.
#:
#:  Rather than keep a list of unique 3-letter string identifiers for each
#:  menu, version 4 has a separate file for each menu.
#:
#:    MENU                LIBRARY FILE CONTAINING MENU OPTION DATA
#:
#:  Although there are many more files, this makes locating a particular
#:  menu easier and is a more organized method to store related code.
#:
#:  This makes it very easy to add new sub-menus. If you wish to create 
#:  your own custom sub-menu, just create a new library file using an 
#:  existing menu library file as a template.
#:
#:  But as of now, it means that there are over 140 library files for the
#:  over 140 menus in this script.
#:
#: *User-interfaces text (CLI), Dialog, and Whiptail are fully supported
#:  for all menus and message displays. You can switch between them using
#:  the "Configuration Menu".
#:
#:  This is done through functions contained in the library file,
#:  "common_bash_function.lib". Functions f_message and f_create_show_menu
#:  do all the work for you by automatically displaying messages in your
#:  selected user-interface and even automatically calculates the size of
#:  the message boxes for both Dialog and Whiptail.
#:
#: *More fun than just a list of CLI applications!!!
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |       HOW-TO Add a new menu item       |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: In brief:
#
#: 1. Each menu's data is contained in a corresponding library file.
#:
#: 2. If you are adding a NEW APPLICATION within an existing menu,
#:
#:    a) Determine which menu the new application should be added to and
#:       edit the corresponding menu library file.
#:
#:    b) Menu items are in alphabetical order by app or category name.
#:
#:    c) Add the new menu item. (See below for menu format details).
#:
#:    d) An application menu can have a **MAXIMUM OF 16** items.
#:       If you have more, create a new sub-menu or sub-category menu.
#:       This is to comply with a 80x24 line screen which is standard.
#:
#: 3. Example: You want to add a menu item for the elinks web browser.
#:
#:    a) Determine the application category and edit the corresponding
#:       library file containing the menu for that application category.
#:       "elinks" is a web browser, so it would go in the library file,
#:       "apps_internet_web_browsers.lib".
#:
#:    b) Edit the library, "apps_internet_web_browsers.lib" and add the
#:       single line of code under section:
#:                "Customize Menu choice options below."
#:       after the menu option:
#:                "#@@Return#@@Return to previous menu.#@@break"
#:
#: Code to add:
#: #@@elinks#@@Web browser, tables, frames, forms support, tabbed browsing.#@@f_app_cmd^$GUI^elinks^elinks lxer.com#@@0^0^0^1^0
#:       1                                2                                       3      3a    3b          3c              4
#: application name                   Description                              function  GUI   App     App Command      App Code
#:
#:       Note: the application name (1) and the description (2) may include
#:       commas, forward-slashes, dashes are OK.
#:
#:       Forbidden characters include ; : * ' " > < &
#:
#: 4. Explanation of menu option code:
#:
#:    The string is delimited by "#@@" into four parts.
#:
#:    1) elinks - The menu option itself.
#:
#:    2) Web browser, tables, frames, forms support, tabbed browsing.
#:           Description of the menu option.
#:
#:    3) f_app_cmd^$GUI^elinks^elinks lxer.com
#:
#:          f_app_cmd
#:             This function will run when the menu option is selected.
#:
#:             f_app_cmd calls f_app_cmd_2 which verifies that the
#:             user-entered application command (application command with
#:             optional parameters) is a valid command. If so, then it
#:             will run the command if it is already installed, or 
#:             install it, if needed.
#:
#:          ^$GUI^elinks^elinks lxer.com
#:             1     2         3
#:
#:             Arguments and parameters passed to the function f_app_cmd.
#:                         
#:             $1 GUI is "text", "whiptail", or "dialog".
#:
#:             $2 elinks is the application name.
#:
#:             $3 is not used if the application does not need any
#:                additional arguments or parameters.
#:
#:             $3 is used when an application needs additional arguments
#:                            or parameters to operate.
#:
#:       Format: 
#:          f_app_cmd^$GUI^Application^Application <space> arg1 <space> arg2
#:
#:                 (spaces are OK between the application name and the
#:                 multiple arguments or parameters).
#:
#:          Example:
#:                 f_app_cmd^$GUI^elinks^elinks lxer.com
#:
#:                 The default command in the menu will be to open the web
#:                 browser "elinks" to the web site lxer.com.
#:
#:
#:    4) 0^0^0^1^0 - The App Code (APP_CODE variable).
#:       The App Code is delimited by carets (^) into 5 pieces or fields.
#:
#:       <field 4> a Quit-Code "1" which displays message below
#:                 To quit "<application>", type "Q".
#:
#: 5. Detailed explanation of the App Code.
#:
#: field 1    *if 1 then function name is f_<MENU_ITEM_NAME>.
#: 1/0/string *if <string> then function name is <string>.
#:            *if 0 then ignored. No function is run.
#:
#: field 2    *if 1 then function name is f_install_<MENU_ITEM_NAME>.
#: 1/0/string  A function to install an application may be specified here.
#:            *if <string> then function name is <string>.
#:            *if 0 then ignored. No function is run.
#:
#:             This custom installation function is called only after the
#:             distro's software package manager has failed to install the
#:             application usually because the application is not
#:             pre-packaged for the linux distro (distribution).
#:             See f_application_install for more details.
#:
#:             If the install fails, then this custom install function will
#:             be run to download the source code from the application
#:             maintainer's web site. It will then install the application.
#:
#: field 3    *if <string> then function name is <string>.
#: 0/string   *if 0 then ignored. No function is run.
#:             This function is run after displaying the Quit-Code on screen.
#:
#: field 4    *Quit-Code. See f_quit_app_clause for more details.
#: string
#:
#: field 5    *Sets PRESS_KEY=0/1 to display "Press 'Enter' key to continue".
#: 1/0         See f_press_key for more details. This allows the user to
#:             see any messages displayed by the application after it has
#:             been run, but before the menu redisplays. This is only
#:             needed if the application finishes with information on the
#:             screen which you want to look at before the menu redisplays.
#:
#:             This setting may be overridden by any custom functions which
#:             follow. It is useful if the custom function displays a help
#:             message for the menu to display so you don't have to worry
#:             about coding for PRESS_KEY within that custom function.
#:
#:             This can be used to initialize PRESS_KEY as it is set before any
#:             custom functions in fields 1, 2, or 3 are run.
#:
#: Example 1:
#:
#: 0^0^0^0^0 
#: Has no custom functions before running application.
#:
#: 1^0^0^0^1
#: <field 1> a custom function f_<application name> is run before
#:           running the application. 
#: <field 5> displays "Press 'Enter' key to continue" after running the
#:           application.
#:
#:           Normally a CLI app will be run from the command-line and the
#:           previous text would be visible and there is no need to pause
#:           to see the text.
#:
#:           But because the apps are run inside a menu which returns to
#:           the menu after an app is run, a pause to read the previous 
#:           text is sometimes needed.
#:
#: Example 2:
#:
#: 0^1^0^3:NC^0 
#: <field 2> custom install function, f_install_<application name> is run
#:           before running the application.
#:
#:           Custom install functions run if the distro's software package
#:           manager fails to install the application if it is missing.
#:           Usually the custom install function will download, compile
#:           source code from the software maintainer's web site.
#:
#: <field 4> a Quit-Code "3:NC" which displays message below
#:           without clearing screen (NC=No Clear):
#:
#:           To quit <application name>, type "Q" or <F10>
#:
#: Example 3:
#:

#: <field 1> a custom function f_<application name> is run before

#: |   Trouble-shooting a new menu item     |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: 1. Menu will not display properly:
#:
#:    Since the menu option text line is read into an array, certain characters
#:    are not acceptable in an array.
#:
#:    Commas, forward-slashes, dashes are OK.
#:
#:    Semi-colons, colons, asterisks, single-quotes, double-quotes,
#:    greater-than, less-than, ampersands ARE NOT OK.
#:
#:    Forbidden characters include ; : * ' " > < &
#:
#:    Example: Ampersands are not OK and will mess up the menu display. 
#:          
#:    #@@ninvaders#@@Space invaders-like game & ncurses-based.#@@f_app_cmd^$GUI^ninvaders#@@0^0^0^1^1
#:
#: 2. The Dialog or Whiptail box is too small:
#:
#:    The variable TEMP_FILE is not defined to a file name. 
#:    i.e. TEMP_FILE="$CLI_DIR/apps_audio_temp.txt"
#:
#:    The TEMP_FILE is defined in the library file "apps.lib".
#:    The same TEMP_FILE is reused for all the applications in a category.
#:
#:    Audio applications category temp file is:
#:                                       $CLI_DIR/apps_audio_temp.txt
#:
#:    Database applications category temp file is:
#:                                       $CLI_DIR/apps_databases_temp.txt
#:
#:    Development applications category temp file is 
#:                                       $CLI_DIR/apps_development_temp.txt
#:
#:    and so forth...
#:
#:    The TEMP_FILE variable is required by f_message to display any text
#:    which appears on the screen. The function f_message is in the library
#:    "common_bash_function.lib". This function allows menus and messages
#:    to be displayed in Dialog, Whiptail, and text with correct formatting
#:    and with the Dialog/Whiptail box sizes automatically calculated.

#: |        HOW-TO Add a new sub-menu       |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: See library files apps_audio_music_players.lib
#:                    apps_audio_music_players_2.lib
#:
#: Summary:
#: The library file apps_audio_music_players.lib includes a menu option
#: line to run the function f_menu_music_players_2. That function sets the
#: variables required to create the sub-menu and specifies the library file
#: apps_audio_music_players_2.lib which contains the sub-menu item options.
#:
#: 1. Add menu item option "MORE..." to the end of the music players menu
#:    data in the file apps_audio_music_players.lib.
#:
#:    #@@MORE...#@@For more music player applications.#@@f_menu_music_players_2^$GUI#@@0^0^0^0^0
#:
#: 2. Create the library file, apps_audio_music_players_2.lib to contain
#:    the new sub-menu data. You can base it on an existing sub-menu using
#:    it as a template.
#:
#: 3. The "MORE..." option when selected will invoke a new sub-menu in
#:    library file apps_audio_music_players_2.lib.
#:
#:    The function f_menu_music_players_2 within the file
#:    apps_audio_music_players.lib sets variables required to create the
#:    new sub-menu. This function is run when the user selects "MORE..."
#:
#:    The ARRAY_FILE variable is set to the name of the newly created
#:    library file which contains the menu option data for the new sub-menu.
#:    
#:    ARRAY_FILE="$CLI_DIR/apps_audio_music_players_2.lib"

#: |     Known problems and limitations     |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: 1. The files cliappmenu.sh, cliappmenu.lib, and common_bash_function.lib
#:    must be in the same folder. All other files must be in the sub-directory cliapp-dir
#:    
#: 2. Option for automatic software installation only for distributions which
#:    use apt, rpm, slackpkg, and pacman; all others must install manually.
#:
#: 3. For Slackware-based distros which use slackpkg, even though you can
#:    install software, I have not figured out a way to determine if
#:    "slackpkg install <package name> was successful or not. 
#:    The command results in error code zero $?=0 even if install fails.
#:    As a result, I commented out the code which traps slackpkg installation
#:    errors, shows an error message and asks if you want to download the
#:    source code from the developer's web site.
