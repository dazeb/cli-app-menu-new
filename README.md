# cli-app-menu-new
CLI Menu of Linux CLI Apps to automatically install and run CLI apps
(Command Line Applications for Linux) written in BASH script.

2024-02-20 *Release Version 6.0 "Hannah"
           *cliappmenu.sh can be run by itself as a stand-alone script.
            This single file and an internet connection to GitHub.com
            is all you need to get started.
            When run, it will automatically download all the required
            files from either the GitHub Repository "cli-app-menu-new"
            website or a local LAN Repository.
           *This uses a new function to create the Main and sub-menus
            which uses far less passed parameters.
            This change makes the specifying of sub-menus much simpler
            using only 3 passed parameters.
           *f_menu_main_all_menus added replacing f_menu_main and is
            used for both the Main Menu and all sub-menus.
