# cli-app-menu-new
CLI Menu of Linux CLI Apps to automatically install and run CLI apps
(Command Line Applications for Linux) written in BASH script.

2022-07-24 *Release version 5.0 "Gail".
            This is a total rewrite of the menu display process and
            uses fewer library files as a result.
            
           *This version uses the menu titles themselves to differentiate
            the menu data for each menu, rather than use a unique
            3-letter string identifier (versions 1 to 3) or putting
            related menu data in separate files (version 4).
            
           *Since the menus and menu data are differentiated by the menu
            title string, all the menu data was consolidated into only a
            few library files.
