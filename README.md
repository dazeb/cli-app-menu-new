# cli-app-menu-new
CLI Menu of Linux CLI Apps to automatically install and run CLI apps (Command Line Applications for Linux) written in BASH script. Version 4 is a total rewrite of Version 3 and uses generated menus from array data rather than hard-coded menus. The generated menus may be displayed by text, Dialog, or Whiptail user-interfaces.
